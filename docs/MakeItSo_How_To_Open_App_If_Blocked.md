# How to Open the “Make It So” App if Your Mac Blocks It (Two Easy Ways)

If your Mac says it **can’t open the app** because it’s from an *unidentified developer*, don’t worry.
That’s normal for new/beta apps that weren’t downloaded from the App Store.

Below are **two simple ways** to open it. You only need to do this **once**.

---

## Option 1 (Recommended): Use **System Settings → Open Anyway**

1. **Double‑click** the “Make It So” app.
2. If a warning appears, click **OK** to close it.
3. Click the ** Apple menu** (top‑left of your screen) → **System Settings**  
   (on older Macs, this may be **System Preferences**).
4. Click **Privacy & Security**.
5. Scroll until you see a message like:  
   **“‘Make It So’ was blocked from use because it is not from an identified developer.”**
6. Click **Open Anyway**.
7. A confirmation box appears — click **Open**.

> After this, the app should open normally next time (no extra steps).

## Option 2: **Right‑click (or Control‑click) → Open**

1. **Right‑click** (or **Control‑click**) the “Make It So” app icon.
2. Choose **Open** from the small menu.
3. A warning appears again, but this time it has an **Open** button — click **Open**.

> This also tells your Mac to trust the app. You usually won’t see the warning again.

## Tips

- Seeing *“Apple cannot check it for malicious software”* is expected for test builds.
- If you still get blocked, repeat **Option 1** — it’s the most reliable path.
