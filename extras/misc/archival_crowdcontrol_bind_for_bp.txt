This bind makes it easier by utilizing the support all at once instead of keeping track of 3 separate binds.

autoexec.cfg:

# Crowd Control Announcement Mode
alias cc_ice     "echo Ice Bomb!; icebomb; wait 15; cc_flame"
alias cc_flame   "echo Flamecanon!; Flamecanon; wait 15; cc_grenade"
alias cc_grenade "echo Grenade Toss!; grenadetoss"

gzdoom.ini: 

F=+crowdcontrol

Tip 1: 

If/when editing, I suggest clearing out aliases under [Doom.ConsoleAliases] in gzdoom.ini if you make changes in autoexec.cfg, like for example, I would erase these if I were to rebind or change the order etc:

Tip 2:

Remove echo Ice Bomb!; echo Flamecanon!; echo Grenade Toss!; etc for silence.
